# Feature Specification: Rampa Cash Remittances App

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-rampa-cash`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a solana based remittances app, I want it to be secure and fast, the philosofy of the app is to help people to send money home with a low fees and fast deliverance, my focus will be the spain/germany to latam corridor as those countries have the most amounts of latin americans immigrants, there should be a mobile app and a web app, the focus should be simplicity as the main objective user should be normal persons that doesn't know anything about web3, the user should be able to log in using google and apple and so creating a non custodial wallet in the proces, and also it's possible to log in using already created wallets (phantom wallet or solflare) for advance users, we need to have a dashboard with the recent transactions, and the wallet balance, we should have a contact list for easy sending, each contact is an user in the app and should have it's own wallet when loggin in, we should be able to send USDC, EURC and SOL, we send those tokens and the recipient receive them, we don't do the conversion rates between tokens, the user should be able to top up the wallet using normal methods like SEPA transfer or Credit card, and so, send their balance to their bank (on and off ramping using parners will be implemented), we also should offer a VISA credit card if the user want to use their money right away without widhdrawing it in a bank"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** Latin American immigrant in Spain/Germany, **I want to** send money home quickly and cheaply **so that** my family can receive funds without high fees or long delays.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user opens the app, **When** they sign in with Google/Apple, **Then** a non-custodial wallet is automatically created and they can start using the app
2. **Given** a user has funds in their wallet, **When** they select a contact and send USDC/EURC/SOL, **Then** the recipient receives the tokens in their wallet
3. **Given** a user wants to add funds, **When** they choose SEPA transfer or credit card, **Then** their wallet balance is updated with the purchased tokens
4. **Given** a user wants to withdraw funds, **When** they request a bank transfer, **Then** their tokens are converted to fiat and sent to their bank account
5. **Given** a user has a VISA card, **When** they make a purchase, **Then** their wallet balance is debited for the transaction amount
6. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** they see their wallet balance and recent transaction history

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to send more tokens than they have in their wallet?
- How does the system handle failed transactions on the blockchain?
- What happens when a recipient doesn't have the app installed?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during transactions?
- What happens when a user tries to send to an invalid wallet address?
